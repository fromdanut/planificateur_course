A Symfony project created on June 15, 2017, 10:34 pm.

## Presentation :

It's a "marmiton" like website. User can stock/create/edit recipes and ingredients. Plus, the user can create a shopping list from a list of recipes. The shopping list is ordered by group of ingredients (with price for each groups and the total price).
