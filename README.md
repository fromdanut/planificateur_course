Planificateur de courses
========================

A Symfony project created on June 15, 2017, 10:34 pm.

## Presentation :

It's a recipe website. User can stock/create/edit recipes. Plus, the user can create a shopping list from a list of recipes. The shopping list is ordered by group of ingredients (with price for each groups and the total price). Eventually users can use this shopping list while shopping.

See the result on [website](#)

## Improvement for next version :

- add a service to send the shopping list via mail.
- translate in English.
- extend database with new ingredients.
