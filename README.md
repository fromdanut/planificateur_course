Planificateur de courses
========================

A Symfony project created on June 15, 2017, 10:34 pm.

## Presentation :

It's a recipe website. User can stock/create/edit recipes. Plus, the user can create a shopping list from a list of recipes. The shopping list is ordered by group of ingredients (with price for each groups and the total price). Eventually users can use this shopping list while shopping.

## Improvement for next version :

- add a service to send the shopping list via mail.
- translate in English.
- extend database with new ingredients.
